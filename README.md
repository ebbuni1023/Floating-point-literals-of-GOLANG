# Floating-point-literals-of-GOLANG
Programmatically a state diagram to recognize the floating-point literals of GO LANG. This program can be written in any language you choose but must take in a string or character array value as input and return if that value matches the format of a floating point literal in go. It may be wise to use an enumeration type to track state transitions.
